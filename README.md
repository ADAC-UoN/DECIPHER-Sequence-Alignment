# DECIPHER-Sequence-Alignment
High throughput nucleotide and protein secondary structure based alignment R script, created from the R package DECIPHER doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0749-z

change path to directory containing multifasta file of nucelotide sequences

hash/unhash nucelotide or protin alignment (ORF can be selected for protein alignment if know, leave black for the script to calculate)

visual alignment will be written to a html file
multifasta alignment file will be produced
